<h2>Happy Today ?</h2>

<h3>Yep! If you are in a better mood today, you will have a good dream in the night.</h3>
<h3>Wow! If you are in a better mood this month, you will have a better spirit towards life.</h3>
<h3>Great! If you are in a better mood this year, you will have a constructive progress that you can see.</h3>
<h2>Want to EyE on your mood ? </h2>
<h3>Better have a try ! </h3>

<p>
Intention: I want to watch my everyday's expenditure and mood, and by the way take a short record on what I have done in a day. Then I will have a look at the total expendure and average scores within several successive days, say 30 days.If the result shows that I spend too much money and get in a bad mood these days, I will adjust myself accordingly for my life and health, say do more exercise or take. Apparently, life and health are the most important support to our daily progress ! Maybe data can help me find out the relation between my expendure and my mood even though it's not the only target, I hope that. 
</p>
<p>I think I need help in the next processes of build-up and optimization. </p>
